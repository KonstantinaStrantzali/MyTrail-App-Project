![Final project image home page](documentation/responsive-site.png)

This website provides a platform to users who love sharing trail as well as exploring and discovering new trails. As more and more users starting using the service, the website become a free resource. The main goal of this project is a database maintenance attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality. The site is designed to be responsive on a range of devices to make it accessible for trail lovers.

## **Design**

### Colour Scheme

![Colours used in this site](documentation/website-palette.png)

* This Coloors palette was chosen to include only earth tone colors to make the user feels closer to the nature. The main color is Brown which found everywhere in nature â€“ trees, animals, the soil and perfectly matches with the theme of the website. 

### Typography

* The website uses an easily readable font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato) called Lato used for all the content, buttons and headings. This font was chosen to match with the sense of simplicity and minimalism provided by the nature related website.

### Imagery

* The icons in the site were taken from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and used in the forms, logo and cards for styling, emphasizing the costumed fields and impoving the site's readability.
* All the images used were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which offers royalty free images and were chosen to complement the colour scheme of the website.
- The [Home page](static/images/welcome-image.jpg) show a nice background, visually appealing image and while welcoming the user.
- The [Register page](static/images/register-image.png) has a strong mountain background image and make the site inviting.
- The [Login page](static/images/singIn-image.png) has an other beautiful nature scened image making the site welcoming for the user.
- The rest of pages, used [hero image](static/images/profile-image.avif) as general image background to keep consistency and harmony in terms of web design across the site.


### **Wireframes**

The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) for Desktop, Ipad and Mobile viewport.

 - To allow users to delete their account.
 - To allow users to comment below other users trails posts.
 - To give the right to admin to delete other users profiles.
 - Allowing a user to upload images from their device.
 - To add a system where the user would be able to find cafe, restaurants and hotel close to the trails.

## **Deployment**
 
 ### Initial Deployment
 
 **Requirements for Demployment**
  * Python, MongoDB account and database as well as Github and Heroku account is needed.

The project was developed using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) then deployed on Heroku using these instructions:

 
 1. A requirements.txt file created using command *pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt*
 2. A .gitignore file created in my repository.
 3. A `env.py` and `__pycache__/` added into my .gitignore file, for the avoidance of any sensitive information being added into the repository.
 4. An env.py file created and added the following information to it, replacing the '## x ##' values with my own values:

        ``` python
        import os

        os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
        os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
        os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", " ## YOUR SECRET_KEY ## ")
        os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", " ## YOUR MONGO_URI ## ")
        os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB", " ## YOUR MONGO_DBNAME ## ")
        ```
   
5. A Procfile created using the terminal command *echo web: python app.py > Procfile* after making sure there was no stray line in the file as this can cause issues during Heroku deployment.
6. Commit and push to Github the new requirements created above.
7. New app created in Heroku by clicking "New" and "Create New App", setting the region to the closest location and giving the project name.
8. On Heroku dashboard "Deplay" clicked and then from "Deployment Method", GitHub selected.
9. Searched for GitHub repo and connected.
10. In dashboard "Settings" needs to be clicked and then "Reveal Config Vars"
11. Config vars need to be set:
Table:

| Key          | Value |
| ------------ |--------- |
| PORT         | 5000 |
| IP           | 0.0.0.0 |
| MONGO_URI    | USER_MONGODB_URI |
| MONGO_DBNAME | USER_MONGODB_NAME |
| Secret_Key   | USER_SECRET_KEY |
 
 13. On the 'Deploy' tab, 'Enable Automatic Deployment' was clicked.
 14. In 'Manual Deploy', 'master' branch was chosen.
 15.'Deploy Branch' was clicked to deploy the app onto the Heroku servers.
 16. Once the app had finished building, 'Open App' to open my site was clicked.
