## **Design**

### Colour Scheme

![Colours used in this site](documentation/website-palette.png)

* This Coloors palette was chosen to include only earth tone colors to make the user feels closer to the nature. The main color is Brown which found everywhere in nature â€“ trees, animals, the soil and perfectly matches with the theme of the website. 

### Typography

* The website uses an easily readable font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato) called Lato used for all the content, buttons and headings. This font was chosen to match with the sense of simplicity and minimalism provided by the nature related website.

### Imagery

* The icons in the site were taken from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and used in the forms, logo and cards for styling, emphasizing the costumed fields and impoving the site's readability.
* All the images used were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which offers royalty free images and were chosen to complement the colour scheme of the website.
- The [Home page](static/images/welcome-image.jpg) show a nice background, visually appealing image and while welcoming the user.
- The [Register page](static/images/register-image.png) has a strong mountain background image and make the site inviting.
- The [Login page](static/images/singIn-image.png) has an other beautiful nature scened image making the site welcoming for the user.
- The rest of pages, used [hero image](static/images/profile-image.avif) as general image background to keep consistency and harmony in terms of web design across the site.


### **Wireframes**

The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) for Desktop, Ipad and Mobile viewport.
